## .ENV Setup

For security reasons, environment files have been omitted from this repository.

In order to access the databases locally, you will need to create two .env files named '.env.test' and '.env.development'

The created .env files should contain a single line as formatted below.

```
PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>
```
